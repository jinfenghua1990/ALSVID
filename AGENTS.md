> ⛔ **ALSVID ONE-SYSTEM CONTRACT (owner decision 2026-10-26) — mandatory for every AI/agent/developer.**
>
> **Read first:** [docs/ONE_SYSTEM_DEVELOPMENT_CONTRACT.md](docs/ONE_SYSTEM_DEVELOPMENT_CONTRACT.md) from the CURRENT main branch, then the architecture and data ownership files below. ALSVID is ONE integrated monorepo and modular-monolith business platform, not separate module systems to join afterward. Web/API/Worker are processes of that system; Official/Admin/Dealer/My/Supplier remain distinct permission-scoped user experiences but SHARE domain contracts and authoritative data. Never fork standalone systems, duplicate identity/orders/stock/business databases, or add an independent deployment/DB without explicit owner approval and an ADR.
>
> Before changing a module, identify upstream/downstream business contracts, IDs, states, write authorities and required integration tests; implement the affected producers AND consumers as one compatible change. Resolve conflicts within the task branch/PR BEFORE merge; do NOT ask a future agent to figure out integration. Protect Production credentials/data. All agents must follow the PR integration checklist and CI gates. **Documentation alone cannot force agents that never read the repo; branch protection and CI enforce only checks actually configured and executed.**

# ALSVID Agent Contract

This repository is the clean-slate implementation authority for ALSVID.

## Read first

Before changing application behavior or architecture, read in this order:

For portal UI, design-tool ownership, supplier work, and storefront checkout/payment work, also read `docs/DESIGN_TOOL_AND_PORTAL_BOUNDARY_2026-10-16.md`, `docs/PORTAL_DELIVERY_PLAN_2026-10-16.md`, ADR 0004 and [ADR 0005](docs/adr/0005-alsvid-owned-storefront-and-third-party-payments.md). ADR 0005 supersedes the earlier Shopify-first storefront transaction decision. Do not infer delivered capability from a design file, a role seed or a route alone.

1. `docs/PROJECT_MEMORY_INDEX.md` (统一入口：Admin 只读架构页，GitHub 长期记忆源)
2. `knowledge/README.md`
3. `knowledge/00-Company/Architecture.md`
4. `docs/AI_CONTEXT.md`
5. `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`
6. `docs/BUSINESS_BOUNDARY.md`
7. `docs/DATABASE_DECISION.md`
8. `docs/RUNTIME_DECISION.md`
9. `docs/STORAGE_DECISION.md`
10. `docs/ENVIRONMENT_STRATEGY.md`
11. `docs/OPERATIONS.md`
12. `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`
13. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
14. `docs/DOMAIN_STRUCTURE.md`
15. `docs/DATA_OWNERSHIP.md`
16. `docs/BUSINESS_FLOWS.md`
17. relevant ADRs under `docs/adr/`
18. the current issue/PR and affected `domain.json`
19. `docs/ENVIRONMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`

For product, brand, website, dealer, customer-support, commerce or AI work, also read the relevant files under `knowledge/`. The knowledge base is the shared ALSVID business context; this file and the `docs/` files remain authoritative for engineering constraints. For ALSVID WWW, My ALSVID or Dealer Portal web UI, follow `docs/ALSVID_WEB_I18N_STANDARD.md`. ALSVID-owned storefront copy must use the shared locale catalogs; any future provider-hosted payment UI must be reviewed for locale coverage separately.

Confirmed architecture decisions are not suggestions. Do not replace providers, redraw system boundaries, or add major infrastructure merely because a different stack appears fashionable. First identify the concrete problem, review the recorded rationale, and document the new decision.

## Current rebuild gate

Issue #20 is closed and the platform-core encapsulation gate is complete. Continue through the prioritized backlog (#123); do not restart the completed rebuild or enlarge legacy implementations. New capability must retain domain encapsulation and pass `pnpm arch:check`.

Production has been deployed. Never assume a target has no business data based on older pre-deployment notes; verify its state before a destructive operation.

## Non-negotiable business boundaries

- Do not copy runtime code, migrations, schemas or compatibility layers from ChaiBen-OS or the previous ALSVID repository.
- Historical repositories are requirement references only.
- ALSVID is for the bicycle/export/Europe business.
- 1688, JackYun/吉客云, domestic China settlement/tax workflows and CoffeeBear-specific behavior are out of scope.
- ALSVID Commerce owns ALSVID's first-party B2C storefront flow: product selection, cart, checkout orchestration, customer order record and customer-visible order state. A payment service provider (PSP) performs payment processing. This is not a general-purpose OMS and does not replace WMS execution. Shopify is not required for the first release; adding it later requires a new owner decision and an explicit external-channel boundary.
- Ardot owns Admin operations design; Figma owns final external-portal UI. Keep one confirmed design source per page and reuse existing implementation incrementally.
- Supplier self-service is a confirmed phased target (#185). Upstream supplier proposals/PO commitments belong to ALSVID Procurement; supplier membership and dealer membership remain separate from consumer storefront checkout identity. Shared Partner identity does not merge Supplier/Dealer permissions.
- External portal APIs must enforce organization/ownership scope server-side. A role, shared Cookie or matching email is not a business entitlement; consult the portal delivery plan before exposing existing internal APIs.
- WMS remains the warehouse-execution authority for receiving, picking, packing, dispatch and warehouse-side fulfillment facts.
- ALSVID may store only transaction facts required for its own storefront, customer order history, Finance, vehicle lifecycle and reconciliation. For optional external channels or WMS, store/cache only required facts; do not clone complete external-platform or WMS databases.
- PostgreSQL is authoritative for structured ALSVID business facts. R2/S3-compatible storage holds binary objects only.
- Email and AI integrations are provider-neutral; business domains depend on ports, never vendor SDKs.

## Confirmed infrastructure direction

- Production runtime primary: Google Cloud Run.
- Runtime fallback 1: Railway.
- Runtime fallback 2: Apply.Build.
- Database standard: PostgreSQL.
- Production database primary: Neon PostgreSQL.
- Database migration alternative: Supabase PostgreSQL.
- Object storage primary: Cloudflare R2 behind S3-compatible ports/adapters.
- Development workflow (owner decision, 2026-10-21): edit application code directly through GitHub task branches/PRs; run builds, tests and browser previews on disposable GitHub Actions runners; deploy verified main commits through the existing Cloud Run release workflows. Codespaces is optional, never a prerequisite. Do not clone, install, build or run ALSVID development servers on home/company workstations.
- Production is the only active cloud runtime; the former shared Cloud Run Development/Test runtime in `alsvid-dev` is retired. **Observed live deployment (2026-10-25, run #40169393607):** `GCP_PROJECT_ID=alsvid-production`, region `europe-west1`. The separately created `alsvid-prod` project is an intended migration target, **not a verified deployed replacement**. Never silently retarget GitHub production variables, credentials, database or DNS; require an audited cutover and rollback plan.
- Local/CI databases and storage are isolated and temporary. Do not assume Neon/R2 Test resources exist, and never use Production credentials for validation.
- Q4 is not currently part of the Production disaster-recovery architecture; full DR is deferred.

## Admin record-list design

- For business record lists (orders, products, inventory and similar), use a compact table by default. Reuse the shared `av-tablewrap` / `av-table` styles and `av-table-record-meta` for grouped record headings.
- Place status filters, search and available actions above the table; keep table headings visible even when there are no records. Do not replace individual rows with cards unless the owner explicitly requests that presentation.
- Show only real data and supported actions. Keep existing permissions, workflows and domain-owned records intact.

## Architecture rules

- ALSVID remains a modular monolith unless an ADR proves a real need for service separation.
- Public product pages (FC1, FC2/Pilot X5, L7, L8 and accessories) are routes in the shared Next.js Web application deployed as Cloud Run Service `alsvid-web`; shared backend requests use `alsvid-api`. Product models are not deployment units. Never create one Cloud Run service per product/model without a new owner-approved ADR.
- Follow `docs/DOMAIN_STRUCTURE.md`.
- `domains/<domain>/src/index.ts` is a public facade only once a domain is encapsulated.
- Core/application code cannot import provider SDKs or framework transport code.
- Apps import domains only through `@alsvid/<domain>` public facades.
- Cross-domain writes happen through public application contracts/events, never direct table mutation.
- Domain-specific SQL belongs in that domain's infrastructure layer.
- `@alsvid/database` provides mechanics, not business repositories.
- Long-running work uses durable job/outbox patterns through the worker.
- External systems are adapters behind `@alsvid/ports` or domain-specific ports.
- Prefer explicit state machines and immutable history for vehicles, inventory, money, consent and audit-sensitive facts.
- `pnpm arch:check` is a required CI gate. Do not weaken it to make a shortcut pass.

## Core identity rules

- Partner is the shared legal/business/person identity foundation.
- Product is not Vehicle.
- Product hierarchy: Platform -> Model -> Variant -> SKU -> BOM Revision / Build Specification -> Vehicle.
- One physical bicycle has one Vehicle identity; frame number becomes immutable after birth.
- Ownership changes append history; they do not erase the previous owner period.

## Database

- Production has live deployments. Schema migrations must preserve existing data, authorization and rollback/forward-fix safety. Never assume an empty database or perform destructive baseline cleanup without separately verified data ownership, backup/restore evidence and a reviewed migration plan.
- Monetary values require currency and decimal-safe storage.
- Inventory truth is movement-ledger based.
- Finance truth separates document, obligation, payment and allocation.
- Every business fact has one write authority as defined in `docs/DATA_OWNERSHIP.md`.

## External data freshness

At the current stage, optional external-channel/WMS integration does not require permanent real-time synchronization by default.

- Scheduled synchronization/reconciliation runs at least once per day.
- Customer/staff pages normally use the latest successfully cached ALSVID facts.
- My ALSVID / after-sales may expose `Refresh latest status` for on-demand refresh.
- The UI should show the last successful update time and expected refresh behavior.
- Real-time webhooks are an optional future optimization only when a real business need justifies them.

## Delivery discipline

- Current environment names: GitHub branch development, ephemeral CI, and Production. Codespaces is an optional development tool. `ALSVID Development` refers only to the retired historical cloud runtime; `ALSVID Production` is the active cloud runtime.
- Following the owner-approved 2026-10-14 Production-only decision, reviewed PRs target `main`; `develop` is optional and does not deploy a separate cloud runtime.
- `CI` contains code verification and isolated Docker acceptance. Keep the `verify` and `containers` checks; they use disposable GitHub runners and no Production credentials.
- Production starts only after successful main CI (push or explicit workflow dispatch after a bot merge) for the exact commit. The release gate verifies both jobs and rejects obsolete automatic releases. Explicit rollback may select a previously successful Production release.
- Do not restore the retired Development Build, Development Deploy or promotion workflows without a new owner decision.
- Every meaningful change maps to an issue or coherent PR.
- Update `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` only when behavior or architecture becomes real.
- Add tests for changed invariants.
- Do not add secrets, credentials or real customer data.
- Prefer one clean implementation over compatibility shims for code that has never been deployed.
- CI validates a software version/commit; it never promotes test data into Production.
- Production changes must remain reproducible from GitHub source and documented configuration.

## 多设备与多 AI 协作规则（2026-10-18）

- 开工先读取当前 main、相关开放 PR 和工作树状态；已有任务优先续接原分支/PR，禁止从过期聊天快照覆盖代码。
- 一项任务一个短期分支和 PR；不要直接推送 main。代码直接在 GitHub 任务分支修改，独立 AI 通过已推送的提交、分支和 PR 交接；Codespace 为可选工具。
- 修改前 fetch 最新远端；脏工作树先保留并确认归属，不得 reset --hard、清理未跟踪文件、覆盖他人修改或强推共享分支。发现同文件并行工作先在 PR 说明并协调。
- 提交前检查 diff、密钥与相关验证；推送前再次检查远端分支，处理冲突并复验。禁止为了过 CI 而弱化检查。
- 交接写清仓库、分支、基准/当前 SHA、PR、已修改文件、验证结果、未提交内容和下一步。未提交修改不是 GitHub 备份。
- AGENTS.md 只约束实际读取并遵循它的工具；权限、分支保护和 CI 才能提供服务器侧约束。不得宣称所有机器人会自动读取。
- 不提交生产凭据或真实业务数据；代码回滚不等于数据库、对象存储和运行数据恢复。

开发入口和恢复操作见 `docs/COLLABORATION.md`。用户于 2026-10-21 确认：直接在 GitHub 开发，GitHub Actions 完成代码检查、构建与浏览器预览，再通过现有流水线发布 Cloud Run 供用户查看；不要求 Codespace。该决定取代 2026-10-18 的 Codespace 前置限制。仍禁止在家里或公司电脑重新克隆仓库、安装项目依赖、构建或启动 localhost 开发服务；不新增共享 Cloud Run Test 环境。

## 可选 AI 工具链（2026-10-19）

具体安装方法、隐私边界和验收状态见 [docs/AI_TOOLCHAIN.md](docs/AI_TOOLCHAIN.md)。

- Playwright 已通过 `.github/workflows/fc1-preview.yml` 在 PR 临时 CI 中使用，并新增官网多语言/桌面/移动端冒烟检查；不要在 Production 容器中安装浏览器工具。
- Superpowers 和 Claude-Mem 是特定 Agent 的可选本地技能/记忆，不取代仓库 `AGENTS.md`、`knowledge/`、`docs/`、Git 提交和 PR 交接；其他机器人不会因为安装到某一个 Codespace 就自动获得这些能力。
- HyperFrames 是可选视频产出工具，与官网交互动画的上线代码分开管理。
- 在 Codespaces 中按需手动执行 `bash scripts/setup-optional-dev-tools.sh all`；未经执行和验收不得声称工具已安装，不向第三方记忆工具传输客户隐私或生产密钥。
